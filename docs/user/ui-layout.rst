Opening Page
============

When you first start the program, it opens to this page:

From this page, you can open a new data file to visualize by either clicking the "Open Data File"
in the center of the page, or by using the File>Open... :ref:`menu item <file-menu>`.

Main Window
===========

Once a data file has been opened, the window is broken into 3 sections: the :doc:`left-panel`,
the :doc:`3d-view`, and the :doc:`dock-panes` on the sides.
